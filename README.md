# Hall-Sensor-Grid
Here you will find the PCB models and pictures for the code of the Hall Sensor Grid for the automatic chess engine.

Design requires a moderate understanding of the operation of a hall sensor and the basic principles of electronics.
Operation requires a proper understanding of Serial communication.

Some alterations in terms of pull-down resistors are required if you use a different Hall Senor for the design.
Other implementaions can also be used to do the same.
